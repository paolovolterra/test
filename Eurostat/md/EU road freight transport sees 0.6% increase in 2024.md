In 2024, [road freight](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Road_freight_transport) transport in the [EU](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:European_Union_\(EU\)) remained robust, with the total annual volume reaching 1Â 869 billion [tonne-kilometres](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Tonne-kilometre_\(tkm\)), slightly up from 1 857 billion in 2023, representing a marginal 0.6% year-on-year increase.

Poland continued to lead all EU countries in road freight transport in 2024, registering a total of 368 billion tonne-kilometres, nearly 20% of the EU total. It was followed by Germany, with 281 billion (15%); Spain, with 272 billion (15%); France, with 174 billion (9%); and Italy, with 153 billion (8%). These 5 countries accounted for 67% of the total EU road freight transport. Among smaller economies, notable volumes were also recorded in Czechia (70 billion), Romania (67 billion), Lithuania (66 billion) and the Netherlands (63 billion).

This information comes from [data on road freight transport](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/transport/database?node_code=road_go) published by Eurostat today. The article presents a handful of findings from the more detailed [Statistics Explained article on road freight transport statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Road_freight_transport_statistics).

In terms of groups of products transported in 2024, the top 10 remained the same as in 2023. This stability reflects consistent transport demand across essential supply chains such as food, agriculture, construction materials, and chemicals.

Food products, beverages and tobacco continued to dominate, with 312 billion tonne-kilometres in 2024, followed by grouped goods (different goods transported together), with 237 billion tonne-kilometres.

Agriculture, forestry and fishing products came in third place, with 208 billion tonne-kilometres, followed by other non-metallic mineral products (137 billion), metal ores and other mining/quarrying products (132 billion), and chemicals (116 billion).
