### The EU economy continues growing moderately, despite weakening business climate and mixed environmental developments

The EU economy continues its moderate, steady expansion with GDP growing at a similar rate over the past 6 quarters, accompanied by historically low and stable unemployment, and a continued decline in inflation. At the same time, while bankruptcy declarations fell, economic sentiment weakened further, and fewer new businesses are being registered. Looking at monthly business indicators, industrial production continued its recovery for a third consecutive month, while retail trade remains broadly stable and production in services declined. Both the government deficit and general government gross debt relative to GDP declined, showing improved public finances. As the EU continues its efforts to reduce its environmental impact, recent data present a mixed picture. Greenhouse gas emissions increased while the concentration of air pollutants in EU capitals fell. Meanwhile, monthly electricity consumption decreased, while the share of electricity generated from renewable sources fell.

##### GDP continues its moderate expansion

In the first quarter of 2025, the EU economy continued growing at a positive rate, with a moderate 0.3% quarter-on-quarter [GDP](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-15052025-ap) increase, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate (Figure 1). The consistent quarterly expansion contributed to a year-on-year GDP increase of 1.4% in Q1 2025.

Among the four largest EU economies, Spain continued, leading with a quarter-on-quarter GDP growth of 0.6% in Q1 2025. Italy (0.3%), Germany (0.2%) and France (0.1%) followed with moderate growth in Q1 2025 compared to the previous quarter.

##### Greenhouse gas emissions increase, while air pollutant concentration in capitals fall

In Q4 2024 in the EU, [greenhouse gas emissions](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20250515-1) were estimated at 1.98 t/capita (tonnes per capita), up from 1.7 t/capita in the previous quarter. This increase reflected the typical seasonal pattern seen in previous years (see Figure 2), although emissions exceeded the levels recorded in the same quarter of the previous year. Greenhouse gas emissions rose by 2.2% in Q4 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023, marking the first year-on-year increase since Q2 2022

Emissions varied considerably across Member States in Q3 2024, with Luxembourg and Denmark (both at 3.5 t/capita) and Ireland (3.3 t/capita) recording the highest levels. In contrast, Sweden (1.1 t/capita), Portugal (1.3 t/capita) and France (1.5 t/capita) showed the lowest emissions per capita.

At a more local level, in April 2025 the **average nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration** in the European capital cities decreased by -25.8% compared to the previous month, reaching 19.0 µg/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter). This downward movement started in March 2025 and, while it aligns with the seasonal pattern observed in previous years, the pollutant level in April 2025 was 8.2% lower than in the same month of 2024 (see Figure 3). The average concentration in EU capital cities remains well below the EU target, which stipulates that the annual mean value may not exceed 40 µg/m3.

NO2 concentrations in April 2025 varied widely across the EU capital cities, with levels as low as 7.5 µg/m3 in Copenhagen, 9.5 µg/m3 in Helsinki and 11.2 µg/m3 in Tallinn. By contrast, the highest levels were observed in Bucharest (34.5 microg/m3), Athens (33.9 microg/m3) and Zagreb (27.5 microg/m3). Cross-city variability should be considered keeping in mind that the concentrations of air pollutants are highly dependent on local characteristics, including not only emission sources but also meteorological and topographical conditions.

##### Electricity consumption decreases

In February 2025, electricity consumption by end users in the EU reached 212.06 thousand GWh (gigawatt per hour), which marked a -10.0% decrease compared with the previous month. However, compared with February of the previous year the value grew by 2.1%. Overall, the monthly dynamics of electricity consumption by end users in the EU in the first two month of 2025 followed the pattern observed in the previous two years (see Figure 4).

Among Member States, the highest overall electricity consumption by end users in February 2025 was recorded in France (38,8 thousand GWh), Germany (36.2 thousand GWh) and Italy (24.9 thousand GWh), whereas the countries with the lowest values were Malta (0.2 thousand GWh), Cyprus and Luxembourg (both at 0.5 thousand GWh).

##### Share of renewables in electricity production declines

As the EU strives to decrease both its energy dependency and its environmental and climate impact, its share of net electricity generated from renewable energies reached 39.7% in February 2025, a 1.9 percentage points decrease compared to the previous month and a 7.7 percentage points decrease compared to February 2024 (see Figure 5).

The share of renewables in February 2025 was highest in Norway at 99.0%. Across EU Member States, it varied substantially from 90.7% in Luxembourg, 84.7% in Portugal and 84.6% in Denmark, to 12.6% in Czechia, 13.1% in Malta, and 14.6% in Slovakia.

##### Bankruptcies and new business registrations fall

In Q1 2025, [bankruptcy declarations](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20250516-1) in the EU saw a quarter-on-quarter decrease of – 0.9%, marking a second consecutive decline. Despite this modest fall, the number of bankruptcies remained high compared to considerably lower values in 2021 (see Figure 6). Meanwhile, the number of [new business registrations](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20250516-1) decreased by -5.1% quarter-on-quarter in Q1 2025, marking the first drop since Q2 2024.

Across Member States for which data are available, the highest increases in quarter-on-quarter bankruptcy declarations in Q1 2025 were observed in Greece (35.9%), Sweden (22.7%) and Estonia (20.4%), while the steepest declines were recorded in Cyprus (-70.0%)[[1]](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/dashboard/european-statistical-monitor/#footnote-2), Malta (-66.6%) and Latvia (-21.0%).

##### Inflation further decreases

The [annual inflation rate](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-16042025-ap) in the EU continued to decline, reaching 2.4% in April 2025, down from 2.5% in March and 2.7% in February (see Figure 8).

Across Member States, Romania (4.9%), Estonia (4.4%) and Hungary (4.2%) recorded the highest inflation in April 2025. By contrast, the lowest values were observed in France (0.9%), Cyprus (1.4%) and Denmark (1.5%).

##### Industrial production expands

EU [industrial production](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-euro-indicators/w/4-15042025-ap) continued its recovery after a period of fluctuation (see Figure 9). In March 2025, it expanded month-on-month by 1.9%, following a 1.1% increase in February. These monthly changes marked its steady expansion since the start of 2025 and contributed to the 2.7% year-on-year growth in March 2025 compared to the same month in 2024.

Across Member States, March 2025 saw the largest month-on-month increases in Ireland (14.6%), Malta (4.4%) and Finland (3.5%), while Luxembourg (-6.3%), and Denmark and Greece (both at -4.6%) recorded the strongest declines.

##### Retail trade slightly decreases

Data from March 2025 showed that EU [retail trade](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-euro-indicators/w/4-07052025-ap) remained broadly stable. With a moderate -0.1% decrease in volume, it has hovered around the same level since September 2024 (see Figure 9). In year-on-year terms, retail trade in March 2025 grew by 1.4%.

Across Member States, for which data are available, in March 2025 Malta showed the highest increase of 2.0% month-on-month, followed by Belgium and Croatia, both at 1.4%. In contrast, Slovenia (-2.0%), Estonia (-1.3%) and Slovakia (-0.9%) saw the largest month-on-month contractions in retail trade volumes.

##### Production in services slows down

EU [production in services](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-euro-indicators/w/4-08052025-ap) interrupted its positive evolution observed since September 2024 and in February 2025 recorded a -0.1% decline, slightly falling from its historic high reached in the previous month (see Figure 9). On a year-on-year basis, services production in the EU grew by 2.1% in February 2025.

Looking at Member States for which data are available, in February 2025 the largest month-on-month increases in services production were recorded in Slovakia (1.9%), Belgium (1.1%) and Poland (0.8%). Conversely, Malta (-3.7%), Bulgaria (-1.6%), and Austria and Slovenia (both at -1.4%), recorded the strongest declines.

##### The unemployment rate remains stable and low

In March 2025, the EU [unemployment rate](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-euro-indicators/w/3-02052025-bp) held steady at its historic low of 5.8%, for the sixth consecutive month (see Figure 10), reflecting a persistently positive labour market.

Member States continued showing notable disparities in unemployment rates in March 2025, while national rates remained relatively stable. Czechia (2.6%), Poland (2.7%) and Malta (2.8%) maintained their position as the three countries with the lowest unemployment rates since the start of 2024. Conversely, Spain (10.9%), Finland (9.5%) and Greece (9.0%), experienced the highest rates in March 2025.

##### Government deficit and debt declines

At the EU level, [government deficit](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-22042025-ap) and [general government gross debt](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-22042025-bp), when measured relative to GDP, both declined. The government deficit-to-GDP ratio fell to -3.5% in Q4 2024, down from -2.6% in Q3, while the government debt-to-GDP ratio declined to 81.0% in Q4 2025 compared to 81.6% in the previous quarter (see Figure 11).

Among Member States, Estonia (23.6%), Bulgaria (24.1%) and Luxembourg (26.3%), recorded the lowest government debt-to-GDP ratios in Q4 2024. In contrast, Greece (153.6%), Italy (135.3%) and France (113.1%) showed the highest ratios.![Figure 11: Government debt at the EU level.

1. In small countries the quarterly absolute numbers of bankruptcies are very low. Low numbers can make the indices very volatile, as was the case for Cyprus and Malta in the last quarter. [↑](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/dashboard/european-statistical-monitor/#footnote-ref-2)
