In 2020, the [EU](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:European_Union_\(EU\)) Member States exported to countries outside of the EU services worth €910 billion, a 15% decrease compared with 2019. The [extra-EU](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Extra-EU) imports stood at €878 billion, down by 14% compared with 2019. The decrease in 2020 is due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related sanitary measures. About 90% of the drop in exports and 60% in imports was due to a decrease in travel and transport services.

This information comes from [data](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/international-trade-in-services/database) on EU trade in services published by Eurostat today. This article presents a handful of findings from the more detailed [Statistics Explained](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=International_trade_in_services) article.
